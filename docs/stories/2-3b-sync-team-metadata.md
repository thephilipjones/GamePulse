# Story 2-3b: Sync Team Metadata from NCAA API

**Epic**: Epic 2 - Dimensional Foundation + Game Data Ingestion (Batch)
**Status**: Drafted
**Estimated Effort**: 2-3 hours
**Priority**: Medium (Optional enhancement, prevents future issues)

## User Story

As a data engineer,
I want to automatically discover and sync team metadata from NCAA API game responses,
So that GamePulse can track all teams that play games without requiring manual seed data updates for every team.

## Context

### Current State
GamePulse currently relies on manual seed data (`backend/app/data/teams.json`) containing 20 top NCAA teams with manually curated metadata (colors, aliases, team_group assignments). This seed data is loaded via Alembic migration with upsert logic into the `dim_team` table (refactored in Story 2-3a with surrogate keys).

### The Problem
- NCAA Division I basketball has **350+ teams**
- The season features **5,000+ games** involving teams beyond our initial 20
- When Story 2-4 (Polling Worker) encounters games with unknown teams, foreign key constraints will fail
- Manual maintenance of all 350 teams is unsustainable and error-prone

### The Solution
Implement automatic team discovery by extracting team metadata from NCAA API scoreboard responses. When processing games, sync any new teams to the database before inserting game records. Preserve manually curated data (colors, aliases, conferences) while automating team name and ID management.

### Relationship to Other Stories
- **Story 2-1** (DONE): Created dimensional data structure and seed migration
- **Story 2-2** (DONE): Implemented NCAA API client that fetches game data
- **Story 2-3** (DONE): Created Game model with foreign keys to teams table
- **Story 2-3a** (DONE): Refactored to dimensional model (teams → dim_team, surrogate keys)
- **Story 2-3b** (THIS): Automatically discover teams from API responses using dim_team schema
- **Story 2-3c** (NEXT): Create dim_date dimension table
- **Story 2-4** (NEXT): Dagster polling worker will use team sync before game inserts

### What's In Scope
- ✅ Team discovery from NCAA API game responses
- ✅ Automatic creation of team records with minimal data (name, sport, ESPN ID)
- ✅ Idempotent merge with existing seed data
- ✅ Schema enhancement: Add `espn_team_id` column
- ✅ Logging and observability for team discoveries

### What's Out of Scope
- ❌ team_group/conference fetching (NCAA API doesn't provide this - see Future Enhancements)
- ❌ Team color automation (no API source - see Future Enhancements)
- ❌ Team alias generation (requires domain knowledge - see Future Enhancements)
- ❌ Team logo fetching (not in NCAA API)
- ❌ Historical team data backfill (focus on current season forward)
- ❌ Populating surrogate key team_key (auto-generated by database)

## Acceptance Criteria

### AC1: Team Discovery from API Game Responses
**GIVEN** the NCAA client has fetched today's games from the scoreboard API
**WHEN** processing the game response data
**THEN** the system SHALL:
- Extract unique teams from `home` and `away` fields in each game
- Create team records in `dim_team` table with:
  - `team_id`: Format "ncaam_{espn_team_id}" (e.g., "ncaam_150" for Duke) - natural key
  - `team_key`: Auto-generated SERIAL surrogate key (database handles this)
  - `espn_team_id`: Store raw ESPN team ID from API (e.g., "150")
  - `team_name`: Use `names.short` from API response (e.g., "Duke")
  - `sport`: Set to "ncaam"
  - `is_current`: Default TRUE (SCD Type 2 field from Story 2-3a)
  - `valid_from`: Default NOW() (SCD Type 2 field)
  - `created_at`, `updated_at`: Current UTC timestamp
- Leave `team_abbr`, `primary_color`, `secondary_color`, `aliases`, `team_group_id`, `team_group_name` as NULL for auto-discovered teams

**Validation**:
- Query database after sync, verify new teams exist with correct natural key (`team_id`)
- Verify `team_key` auto-generated (not NULL, unique)
- Verify `espn_team_id` matches API team ID
- Verify `team_name` matches `names.short` from API
- Verify `is_current=TRUE` and `valid_from` is set

### AC2: Idempotent Merge Strategy
**GIVEN** a team already exists in the database (from seed data or previous sync)
**WHEN** syncing teams from API responses
**THEN** the system SHALL:
- Use `ON CONFLICT (team_id) DO UPDATE` pattern (conflict on natural key, not surrogate key)
- UPDATE only these fields if they differ:
  - `team_name` ← from `names.short` (API may have updated name)
  - `espn_team_id` ← from `id` (if previously NULL)
  - `updated_at` ← current UTC timestamp
- PRESERVE (DO NOT overwrite) these manually curated fields:
  - `team_key` (surrogate key - never updated, immutable once generated)
  - `primary_color`
  - `secondary_color`
  - `aliases`
  - `team_group_id`, `team_group_name` (conference assignment)
  - `team_abbr`
  - `is_current`, `valid_from`, `valid_to` (SCD Type 2 fields - Story 11.1 will manage these)

**Validation**:
- Seed data for Duke (ncaam_150) with colors "#003087" and aliases
- Sync team from API response
- Verify `team_key` unchanged (same surrogate key value)
- Verify colors and aliases unchanged
- Verify `team_name` updated if API differs
- Run seed migration again, verify no data loss (idempotent)

### AC3: Logging and Observability
**GIVEN** teams are being synced from API responses
**WHEN** the sync process completes
**THEN** the system SHALL:
- Log each new team discovered:
  - Log level: INFO
  - Message format: "Team discovered from API: {team_id} ({team_name}) - ESPN ID {espn_team_id}"
- Log each team updated:
  - Log level: DEBUG
  - Message format: "Team updated from API: {team_id} - name changed from '{old_name}' to '{new_name}'"
- Return metadata dictionary with counts:
  ```python
  {
      "teams_discovered": 5,  # New teams inserted
      "teams_updated": 2,     # Existing teams updated
      "teams_unchanged": 13   # Teams in API but no changes needed
  }
  ```
- When integrated with Dagster (Story 2-4), include counts in asset materialization metadata

**Validation**:
- Run sync with mix of new and existing teams
- Check logs for discovery and update messages
- Verify metadata counts match actual database changes

### AC4: Graceful Handling of Missing Teams
**GIVEN** a game references a team not yet in the database
**WHEN** the polling worker attempts to insert the game
**THEN** the system SHALL:
- Create minimal team record before game insert (AC1)
- Log warning for manual follow-up:
  - Log level: WARNING
  - Message: "Team {team_id} auto-created with minimal data - consider adding colors/aliases in teams.json"
- Continue processing remaining games (DO NOT fail entire batch)
- Return success with warning count in metadata

**Validation**:
- Process game with team "ncaam_999" (not in seed data)
- Verify team created with NULL colors/aliases
- Verify warning logged
- Verify game inserted successfully with foreign key to new team

### AC5: Migration for espn_team_id Column
**GIVEN** the dim_team table exists from Story 2-3a
**WHEN** running the new Alembic migration
**THEN** the system SHALL:
- Add column: `espn_team_id VARCHAR NULL`
- Add index on `espn_team_id` for lookup performance
- Backfill existing rows by extracting numeric portion from `team_id`:
  - "ncaam_150" → espn_team_id = "150"
  - "ncaam_153" → espn_team_id = "153"
- Verify no data loss (row count unchanged)
- Migration must be reversible (downgrade removes column)

**SQL Example**:
```sql
-- Upgrade
ALTER TABLE dim_team ADD COLUMN espn_team_id VARCHAR;
CREATE INDEX ix_dim_team_espn_team_id ON dim_team(espn_team_id);
UPDATE dim_team SET espn_team_id = SUBSTRING(team_id FROM POSITION('_' IN team_id) + 1);

-- Downgrade
DROP INDEX ix_dim_team_espn_team_id;
ALTER TABLE dim_team DROP COLUMN espn_team_id;
```

**Validation**:
- Run migration upgrade
- Verify column exists: `\d dim_team` in psql
- Verify existing teams have espn_team_id populated
- Verify team_key (surrogate PK) unchanged
- Run migration downgrade, verify column removed
- Run migration upgrade again (idempotent)

### AC6: Documentation and Future Work Tracker
**GIVEN** Story 2-3b is complete
**WHEN** developers or future AI agents need to understand team sync strategy
**THEN** the system SHALL have documentation:

1. **backend/app/data/README.md** (create if doesn't exist):
   - Explain seed data strategy (teams.json is foundation with manual curation)
   - Document merge logic (what's auto-synced vs manually curated)
   - Provide instructions for manual overrides:
     - "To add colors/aliases for auto-discovered team: edit teams.json, add team entry, re-run seed migration"
   - List what fields are preserved vs updated during sync

2. **docs/stories/future-enhancements.md** (append or create):
   - Document future work items:
     - Team colors automation (options: web scraping, third-party API, color extraction)
     - Team aliases generation (options: LLM generation, web scraping, manual)
     - Conference/TeamGroup automation (options: find API source, web scraping, inference)
   - Include effort estimates and priority for each enhancement
   - Note that these are NOT blockers for MVP

**Validation**:
- Files exist at specified paths
- Documentation is clear and actionable
- Future work is tracked for Epic 4+ planning

## Implementation Tasks

### Task 1: Add espn_team_id to DimTeam Model
**Files Modified**:
- `backend/app/models/dim_team.py` (refactored from team.py in Story 2-3a)

**Changes**:
```python
from sqlmodel import SQLModel, Field, Column
from sqlalchemy import Integer, String, ARRAY, Boolean, TIMESTAMP
from datetime import datetime, UTC

class DimTeam(SQLModel, table=True):
    __tablename__ = "dim_team"

    # Surrogate key (PK) - from Story 2-3a
    team_key: int = Field(sa_column=Column(Integer, primary_key=True, autoincrement=True))

    # Natural key (unique) - from Story 2-3a
    team_id: str = Field(unique=True, index=True)
    sport: str = Field(index=True)
    team_name: str
    team_abbr: str | None = None

    # Flattened team_group (from Story 2-3a)
    team_group_id: str | None = None
    team_group_name: str | None = None

    # NEW FIELD (Story 2-3b)
    espn_team_id: str | None = Field(default=None, index=True)

    primary_color: str | None = None
    secondary_color: str | None = None
    aliases: list[str] = Field(default_factory=list, sa_column=Column(ARRAY(String)))

    # SCD Type 2 fields (from Story 2-3a)
    is_current: bool = True
    valid_from: datetime = Field(default_factory=lambda: datetime.now(UTC))
    valid_to: datetime | None = None

    created_at: datetime = Field(default_factory=lambda: datetime.now(UTC))
    updated_at: datetime = Field(default_factory=lambda: datetime.now(UTC))
```

**Alembic Migration**:
```bash
cd backend
alembic revision --autogenerate -m "Add espn_team_id to dim_team table"
# Review generated migration, ensure it includes:
# - ADD COLUMN espn_team_id to dim_team
# - CREATE INDEX
# - UPDATE backfill logic (extract from team_id)
alembic upgrade head
```

**Testing**:
- Unit test: Verify DimTeam model has espn_team_id field
- Migration test: Run upgrade/downgrade cycle
- Integration test: Insert team with espn_team_id, verify indexed lookup
- Verify team_key (surrogate PK) unaffected by migration

### Task 2: Create Team Sync Service
**New File**: `backend/app/services/team_sync.py`

**Function Signature**:
```python
from sqlmodel import Session
from app.models import DimTeam  # Using dimensional model from Story 2-3a

async def sync_teams_from_games(
    games_data: list[dict],
    session: Session
) -> dict[str, int]:
    """
    Extract teams from NCAA API game responses and sync to dim_team table.

    Args:
        games_data: List of game dicts from NCAA API scoreboard response
        session: SQLModel database session

    Returns:
        Metadata dict with counts:
        {
            "teams_discovered": int,  # New teams inserted
            "teams_updated": int,     # Existing teams with changes
            "teams_unchanged": int    # Existing teams, no updates needed
        }

    Note:
        - Uses ON CONFLICT on team_id (natural key), not team_key (surrogate key)
        - team_key is auto-generated by database (SERIAL), never explicitly set
        - Preserves manually curated fields (colors, aliases, team_group_*)
    """
```

**Implementation Logic**:
1. Extract unique teams from games:
   ```python
   teams_in_games = set()
   for game in games_data:
       teams_in_games.add((game["home"]["id"], game["home"]["names"]["short"]))
       teams_in_games.add((game["away"]["id"], game["away"]["names"]["short"]))
   ```

2. Query existing teams:
   ```python
   existing_team_ids = {team.team_id for team in session.exec(
       select(DimTeam.team_id).where(DimTeam.sport == "ncaam")
   )}
   ```

3. Build upsert list:
   ```python
   teams_to_upsert = []
   for espn_id, team_name in teams_in_games:
       team_id = f"ncaam_{espn_id}"
       teams_to_upsert.append({
           "team_id": team_id,
           "espn_team_id": espn_id,
           "team_name": team_name,
           "sport": "ncaam",
           "updated_at": datetime.now(UTC)
       })
   ```

4. Execute batch upsert using PostgreSQL INSERT ... ON CONFLICT:
   ```python
   stmt = postgresql.insert(DimTeam).values(teams_to_upsert)
   stmt = stmt.on_conflict_do_update(
       index_elements=["team_id"],  # Conflict on natural key, NOT team_key
       set_={
           "team_name": stmt.excluded.team_name,
           "espn_team_id": stmt.excluded.espn_team_id,
           "updated_at": stmt.excluded.updated_at
           # NOTE: team_key (surrogate PK) is NEVER updated - immutable once generated
           # NOTE: Preserve colors, aliases, team_group_* (not in set_)
       }
   )
   session.exec(stmt)
   session.commit()
   ```

5. Calculate and return metadata counts

**Testing**:
- Unit test: Mock games data, verify team extraction logic
- Integration test: Real database, verify upsert behavior
- Edge cases: Empty games list, duplicate teams in response, NULL team names

### Task 3: Integrate with NCAA Games Dagster Asset
**File Modified**: `backend/app/assets/ncaa_games.py`

**Integration Point**:
Before processing games in the Dagster asset, call team sync:

```python
from app.services.team_sync import sync_teams_from_games

@asset
def ncaa_games_today(context, ncaa_client: NCAAClient):
    """Fetch and store today's NCAA basketball games."""

    # Fetch games from API
    games_data = ncaa_client.fetch_todays_games()

    # SYNC TEAMS FIRST (Story 2-3b)
    with get_session() as session:
        team_metadata = await sync_teams_from_games(games_data, session)
        context.log.info(f"Team sync: {team_metadata}")
        context.add_output_metadata(team_metadata)

    # Now process games (teams guaranteed to exist)
    games_processed = 0
    with get_session() as session:
        for game_data in games_data:
            game = parse_game_data(game_data)
            session.merge(game)  # Upsert game
            games_processed += 1
        session.commit()

    return MaterializeResult(
        metadata={
            "games_processed": games_processed,
            **team_metadata  # Include team sync counts
        }
    )
```

**Note**: Story 2-4 will implement the full Dagster asset. This task shows the integration pattern.

**Testing**:
- Mock Dagster context and NCAA client
- Verify team sync called before game processing
- Verify metadata includes team counts

### Task 4: Update Seed Data Migration for Idempotency
**File Modified**: `backend/app/alembic/versions/7a8f23177a57_seed_dimensional_data.py`

**Updated Migration** (uses dim_team from Story 2-3a):
```python
def upgrade() -> None:
    # Load seed data from JSON files
    teams_data = json.loads(teams_json_path.read_text())

    # Insert teams with ON CONFLICT DO UPDATE
    for team in teams_data["teams"]:
        op.execute(
            text("""
                INSERT INTO dim_team (team_id, sport, team_name, team_abbr, team_group_id, team_group_name,
                                      primary_color, secondary_color, aliases, espn_team_id,
                                      is_current, valid_from, updated_at)
                VALUES (:team_id, :sport, :team_name, :team_abbr, :team_group_id, :team_group_name,
                       :primary_color, :secondary_color, :aliases, :espn_team_id,
                       TRUE, NOW(), NOW())
                ON CONFLICT (team_id) DO UPDATE SET
                    team_name = EXCLUDED.team_name,
                    team_abbr = EXCLUDED.team_abbr,
                    team_group_id = EXCLUDED.team_group_id,
                    team_group_name = EXCLUDED.team_group_name,
                    primary_color = EXCLUDED.primary_color,
                    secondary_color = EXCLUDED.secondary_color,
                    aliases = EXCLUDED.aliases,
                    espn_team_id = EXCLUDED.espn_team_id,
                    updated_at = EXCLUDED.updated_at
                    -- NOTE: team_key (surrogate PK) NOT updated - immutable
                    -- NOTE: SCD Type 2 fields (is_current, valid_from, valid_to) NOT updated in upsert
            """),
            {
                **team,
                "espn_team_id": team["team_id"].split("_")[1],  # Extract ESPN ID
                "team_group_name": team.get("team_group_name")  # From flattened schema
            }
        )
```

**Changes Needed**:
1. Use `dim_team` table name (from Story 2-3a refactor)
2. Add `team_group_name` (flattened field from Story 2-3a)
3. Add `is_current`, `valid_from` defaults (SCD Type 2 from Story 2-3a)
4. Extract `espn_team_id` from `team_id` during seed data load
5. Verify upsert preserves team_key (surrogate PK) - never updated
6. Verify upsert preserves API-discovered teams if they exist
7. Test: Run migration after team sync, verify no data loss

**Testing**:
- Create auto-discovered team via team_sync
- Run seed migration
- Verify auto-discovered team still exists with same team_key (surrogate key preserved)
- Verify seed data teams updated correctly
- Verify is_current=TRUE for all seeded teams

### Task 5: Add Comprehensive Tests
**New File**: `backend/app/tests/services/test_team_sync.py`

**Test Cases**:

```python
from sqlmodel import select
from app.models import DimTeam  # Using dimensional model from Story 2-3a

def test_discover_new_team(session):
    """New team discovered from API should be inserted with auto-generated team_key."""
    games_data = [
        {
            "home": {"id": "999", "names": {"short": "New Team"}},
            "away": {"id": "150", "names": {"short": "Duke"}}
        }
    ]

    metadata = sync_teams_from_games(games_data, session)

    assert metadata["teams_discovered"] >= 1
    new_team = session.exec(select(DimTeam).where(DimTeam.team_id == "ncaam_999")).one()
    assert new_team is not None
    assert new_team.team_key is not None  # Surrogate key auto-generated
    assert new_team.team_name == "New Team"
    assert new_team.espn_team_id == "999"
    assert new_team.is_current == True
    assert new_team.primary_color is None  # No colors for auto-discovered

def test_preserve_manual_data(session):
    """Existing seeded team should preserve colors/aliases and team_key (surrogate)."""
    # Seed Duke with colors and aliases
    duke = DimTeam(
        team_id="ncaam_150",
        sport="ncaam",
        team_name="Duke Blue Devils",  # Old name
        team_group_id="ncaam_acc",
        team_group_name="Atlantic Coast Conference",
        primary_color="#003087",
        secondary_color="#FFFFFF",
        aliases=["Duke", "Blue Devils"],
        is_current=True
    )
    session.add(duke)
    session.commit()

    original_team_key = duke.team_key  # Save original surrogate key

    # API returns slightly different name
    games_data = [
        {
            "home": {"id": "150", "names": {"short": "Duke"}},
            "away": {"id": "153", "names": {"short": "UNC"}}
        }
    ]

    metadata = sync_teams_from_games(games_data, session)

    assert metadata["teams_updated"] == 1
    updated_duke = session.exec(select(DimTeam).where(DimTeam.team_id == "ncaam_150")).one()
    assert updated_duke.team_name == "Duke"  # Updated from API
    assert updated_duke.team_key == original_team_key  # Surrogate key PRESERVED (immutable)
    assert updated_duke.primary_color == "#003087"  # PRESERVED
    assert updated_duke.secondary_color == "#FFFFFF"  # PRESERVED
    assert updated_duke.aliases == ["Duke", "Blue Devils"]  # PRESERVED
    assert updated_duke.team_group_id == "ncaam_acc"  # PRESERVED
    assert updated_duke.team_group_name == "Atlantic Coast Conference"  # PRESERVED

def test_batch_upsert_efficiency(session, benchmark):
    """Batch upsert should be efficient (single query)."""
    games_data = [
        {
            "home": {"id": str(i), "names": {"short": f"Team {i}"}},
            "away": {"id": str(i+1), "names": {"short": f"Team {i+1}"}}
        }
        for i in range(100)  # 200 unique teams
    ]

    result = benchmark(sync_teams_from_games, games_data, session)

    assert result["teams_discovered"] + result["teams_updated"] == 200
    # Verify single query execution (check logs or query count)
```

**Additional Tests**:
- `test_empty_games_list`: Should return zero counts, not error
- `test_duplicate_teams_in_response`: Should deduplicate
- `test_null_team_name`: Should skip or log error
- `test_concurrent_sync`: Test race conditions with transactions

### Task 6: Create Documentation
**New File**: `backend/app/data/README.md`

```markdown
# GamePulse Dimensional Data

## Overview
Dimensional data (teams, conferences) for GamePulse is managed through a hybrid approach:
- **Manual seed data** provides foundation with curated metadata (colors, aliases, conferences)
- **Automatic API sync** discovers new teams during game ingestion

## Team Data Strategy

### Seed Data (teams.json)
The `teams.json` file contains **manually curated data** for top NCAA teams:
- **Team colors** (primary and secondary hex values for UI theming)
- **Team aliases** (variations for Reddit post matching: "Duke", "Blue Devils", etc.)
- **Conference assignments** (team_group_id for rivalry detection)
- **Abbreviations** (normalized team abbreviations)

**When to update teams.json**:
- Adding colors/aliases for auto-discovered teams
- Correcting team metadata
- Adding new top-tier teams manually

### Automatic API Sync (Story 2-3b)
When processing games from NCAA API, teams are **automatically discovered** and created:
- **Team ID**: Generated as "ncaam_{espn_team_id}"
- **Team name**: Extracted from `names.short` in API response
- **ESPN team ID**: Stored for API correlation

**Auto-discovered teams have**:
- ✅ Team name and ID
- ❌ NULL colors (requires manual addition)
- ❌ NULL aliases (requires manual addition)
- ❌ NULL conference (requires manual addition)

### Merge Logic (Upsert Behavior)
When syncing teams:
- **NEW teams** (not in database): Insert with minimal data from API
- **EXISTING teams** (already in database): Update ONLY:
  - `team_name` (if API differs)
  - `espn_team_id` (if NULL)
  - `updated_at` (timestamp)

**PRESERVED fields** (NEVER overwritten by API sync):
- `primary_color`, `secondary_color`
- `aliases`
- `team_group_id` (conference)
- `team_abbr`

### Manual Override Process
To add colors/aliases for an auto-discovered team:

1. Edit `backend/app/data/teams.json`
2. Add team entry with desired metadata:
   ```json
   {
     "team_id": "ncaam_999",
     "sport": "ncaam",
     "team_name": "New Team",
     "team_abbr": "NEW",
     "team_group_id": "ncaam_acc",
     "primary_color": "#FF5733",
     "secondary_color": "#FFFFFF",
     "aliases": ["New Team", "Newbies", "NT"]
   }
   ```
3. Re-run seed migration: `alembic upgrade head` (idempotent, safe to run multiple times)
4. Verify changes: Query teams table

## Conference Data (TeamGroup)
Conferences are **manually curated only** (no API source):
- `conferences.json` contains 6 major NCAA conferences
- Used for rivalry detection (same conference = 1.2x engagement factor)
- Auto-discovered teams get NULL conference (rivalry factor defaults to 1.0)

**Future enhancement**: Conference automation (see docs/stories/future-enhancements.md)

# GamePulse Future Enhancements

This document tracks potential enhancements that are out of scope for MVP but may be valuable in future iterations.

## Dimensional Data Enhancements

### 1. Team Colors Automation

**Context**: Currently, only 20 teams have manually curated colors in `teams.json`. Auto-discovered teams from Story 2-3b lack colors, resulting in a plain UI for those teams.

**Gap**: 330+ teams need colors for optimal UX (team color accents in game cards, score displays).

**Options**:

1. **Web Scraping from ESPN**
   - Scrape ESPN team pages for official team colors
   - Extract from CSS or team logo images
   - **Pros**: Authoritative source, comprehensive coverage
   - **Cons**: Brittle (HTML changes break scraper), legal concerns
   - **Effort**: 4-6 hours

2. **Third-Party API** (e.g., TeamColors API, TheSportsDB)
   - Use API like `teamcolors.jim-nielsen.com` or SportsDB
   - Map ESPN team IDs to external API IDs
   - **Pros**: Maintained by community, structured data
   - **Cons**: May lack NCAA coverage, requires API key
   - **Effort**: 3-4 hours

3. **Color Extraction from Logos**
   - Fetch team logos from ESPN or NCAA
   - Use Python library (ColorThief, Pillow) to extract dominant colors
   - **Pros**: Automated, no manual curation
   - **Cons**: May not match official branding, requires logo URLs
   - **Effort**: 5-7 hours

4. **Manual Curation** (Status Quo)
   - Continue updating `teams.json` as needed
   - Focus on top 50-100 teams that appear in March Madness
   - **Pros**: Accurate, controlled, simple
   - **Cons**: Labor-intensive for full coverage
   - **Effort**: Ongoing (10-15 minutes per team)

**Recommendation**: Option 2 (Third-Party API) or Option 4 (Manual Curation for top teams)

**Priority**: Low (colors are UI enhancement, not functional requirement)

**Estimated Effort**: 3-7 hours depending on approach

---

### 2. Team Aliases Generation/Fetching

**Context**: Reddit matching (Epic 4) requires team aliases for fuzzy matching. Current seed data has manually curated aliases like ["Duke", "Blue Devils", "Duke Blue Devils", "Blue Devil"] for accurate post detection.

**Gap**: Auto-discovered teams lack aliases, reducing Reddit matching accuracy.

**Options**:

1. **LLM Generation** (GPT-4, Claude)
   - Prompt: "Generate all common aliases and variations for NCAA team '{team_name}'"
   - Example: "Duke Blue Devils" → ["Duke", "Blue Devils", "Dukies", "Blue Devil", "Duke University"]
   - **Pros**: Fast, scales to all teams, creative variations
   - **Cons**: May generate incorrect aliases, requires API cost
   - **Effort**: 6-8 hours (prompt engineering + validation)

2. **Web Scraping** (Wikipedia, ESPN)
   - Scrape Wikipedia infobox for "Nickname" field
   - Parse ESPN team pages for official nicknames
   - **Pros**: Authoritative sources
   - **Cons**: Brittle, misses informal variations (e.g., "Dukies")
   - **Effort**: 8-10 hours

3. **Manual Curation** (Status Quo)
   - Observe Reddit patterns during Epic 4 implementation
   - Add aliases for teams that appear in high-engagement posts
   - **Pros**: Accurate, based on real usage patterns
   - **Cons**: Labor-intensive, reactive (misses posts initially)
   - **Effort**: Ongoing (5-10 minutes per team)

4. **Hybrid: LLM + Manual Validation**
   - LLM generates initial aliases
   - Human reviews and refines based on Reddit observations
   - **Pros**: Best of both worlds (speed + accuracy)
   - **Cons**: Still requires manual review time
   - **Effort**: 6-8 hours (LLM) + ongoing validation

**Recommendation**: Option 4 (LLM + Manual Validation) for top 100 teams

**Priority**: Medium (affects Reddit matching quality in Epic 4)

**Estimated Effort**: 6-10 hours for automated generation + validation

---

### 3. Conference/TeamGroup Automation

**Context**: NCAA API scoreboard endpoint does NOT provide conference data. Current approach: manually curate 6 major conferences in `conferences.json`. Auto-discovered teams get NULL `team_group_id`, which impacts rivalry detection (same conference = 1.2x engagement factor).

**Gap**: 330+ teams across 32 conferences need conference assignments for accurate rivalry detection.

**Options**:

1. **Find Alternative NCAA API Endpoint**
   - Research NCAA official API or other sports data APIs for conference rosters
   - Example: NCAA Stats API, SportsData.io
   - **Pros**: Structured data, authoritative
   - **Cons**: May require paid API, endpoint may not exist
   - **Effort**: 4-6 hours (research + integration)

2. **Web Scraping** (ESPN, Wikipedia)
   - Scrape ESPN conference pages for team rosters
   - Parse Wikipedia "NCAA Division I conferences" for team lists
   - **Pros**: Comprehensive coverage
   - **Cons**: Brittle, changes break scraper
   - **Effort**: 8-12 hours

3. **Inference from Schedule Patterns**
   - Analyze team matchups over time (teams that play each other frequently → same conference)
   - Use clustering algorithms on game history
   - **Pros**: Data-driven, no external dependencies
   - **Cons**: Requires historical data, accuracy varies
   - **Effort**: 12-16 hours (data analysis + algorithm)

4. **Manual Curation** (Status Quo)
   - Maintain 6 major conferences (ACC, Big Ten, Big 12, SEC, Pac-12, Big East)
   - Add others as needed based on game observations
   - **Pros**: Simple, accurate for top conferences
   - **Cons**: Incomplete coverage (misses mid-major rivalries)
   - **Effort**: Ongoing (15-20 minutes per conference)

**Recommendation**: Option 4 (Manual Curation) for MVP; Option 1 (API) if found during Epic 4

**Priority**: Low (rivalry detection has fallback for NULL conference; 6 major conferences cover most high-profile rivalries)

**Estimated Effort**: 8-12 hours depending on data source availability

**Note**: Could be Story 2-3c if API source is discovered, but not needed for MVP.

---

### 4. Historical Team Data Backfill

**Context**: Story 2-3b focuses on forward-looking team discovery (teams that play games going forward). Historical games and team metadata are not backfilled.

**Gap**: No historical team stats, rosters, or past performance data.

**Options**:

1. **Backfill from NCAA API** (if historical endpoint exists)
   - Fetch games from previous seasons
   - Sync teams from those games
   - **Effort**: 4-6 hours

2. **Third-Party Historical Data** (SportsDB, Kaggle datasets)
   - Import historical NCAA team data
   - Merge with current teams
   - **Effort**: 6-10 hours

**Recommendation**: Defer to Epic 5+ (out of scope for MVP)

**Priority**: Low (MVP focuses on current season forward)

---

### 5. Team Roster and Player Data

**Context**: Current team data is high-level (name, colors, conference). No player-level data (names, positions, stats).

**Gap**: Cannot display player-specific insights (e.g., "Top scorer: Player X").

**Options**:

1. **Fetch from NCAA API** (if available)
2. **Scrape from ESPN rosters**
3. **Defer to future epic**

**Recommendation**: Out of scope for MVP (Epic 6+ feature)

**Priority**: Low

---

## Implementation Priority

| Enhancement | Priority | Estimated Effort | Recommended Approach |
|-------------|----------|------------------|---------------------|
| Team Colors | Low | 3-7 hours | Third-party API or Manual (top 100) |
| Team Aliases | Medium | 6-10 hours | LLM + Manual Validation (top 100) |
| Conferences | Low | 8-12 hours | Manual Curation (status quo) |
| Historical Backfill | Low | 6-10 hours | Defer to Epic 5+ |
| Player Rosters | Low | 10-15 hours | Defer to Epic 6+ |

## Notes
- All enhancements are **optional** for MVP
- Priority should be reassessed during Epic 4 (Reddit Matching) based on actual data quality needs
- Manual curation remains viable for top-tier teams (quality over coverage)
```

## Technical Notes

### NCAA API Team Data Structure
From `https://ncaa-api.henrygd.me/scoreboard/basketball-men/d1?date=YYYYMMDD`:
```json
{
  "games": [
    {
      "home": {
        "id": "150",
        "names": {
          "short": "Duke",
          "full": "Duke Blue Devils",
          "seo": "duke-blue-devils",
          "abbrev": "DUKE"
        }
      },
      "away": { ... }
    }
  ]
}
```

**Available fields**:
- `id`: ESPN team ID (string)
- `names.short`: Short name (preferred for team_name)
- `names.full`: Full name with mascot
- `names.abbrev`: Abbreviation (may not always be present)

**NOT available**:
- Conference/division
- Team colors
- Logos (separate endpoint)
- Historical data

### Database Upsert Pattern
PostgreSQL `ON CONFLICT DO UPDATE` allows idempotent merges:
```python
from sqlalchemy.dialects import postgresql

stmt = postgresql.insert(Team).values(teams_to_upsert)
stmt = stmt.on_conflict_do_update(
    index_elements=["team_id"],  # Conflict on primary key
    set_={
        "team_name": stmt.excluded.team_name,  # Update from new data
        "espn_team_id": stmt.excluded.espn_team_id,
        "updated_at": stmt.excluded.updated_at
        # Colors, aliases, conference NOT in set_ → PRESERVED
    }
)
```

### Performance Considerations
- Batch upsert: Single query for all teams (not N queries)
- Index on `espn_team_id` for reverse lookup
- Transaction scope: Sync teams → commit → insert games (two transactions for error isolation)

## Dependencies

### Required Stories (Complete)
- ✅ Story 2-1: Dimensional data structure exists
- ✅ Story 2-2: NCAA client implemented
- ✅ Story 2-3: Game model with foreign keys to teams

### Enables Future Stories
- Story 2-4: Dagster polling worker (needs team sync before game inserts)
- Epic 4: Reddit matching (needs team aliases)

### Blocked By
None - can be implemented immediately after Story 2-3.

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Tests
- `test_team_sync.py`: Core sync logic (discovery, merge, counts)
- Mock NCAA API responses
- Test edge cases (empty games, NULL names, duplicates)

### Integration Tests
- Real database (test container)
- Verify upsert behavior with seed data
- Test migration backfill logic

### Manual Validation
- Run sync against live NCAA API
- Verify auto-discovered teams in database
- Confirm seed data preserved

### Regression Tests
- Re-run seed migration after sync
- Verify no data loss (idempotent)

## Definition of Done

- [ ] `espn_team_id` column added to Team model
- [ ] Alembic migration created and tested (upgrade/downgrade)
- [ ] `team_sync.py` service implemented with batch upsert
